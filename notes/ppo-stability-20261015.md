# PPO stability experiment design

Objective: the user attachment `6bfd2216-f69e-4121-97b8-8f1181e64d2a/pasted-text-1.txt`,
including stable scratch Depth/LiDAR PPO and the original 18-cell BPTT/SHAC/PPO matrix.
This is a working experiment design, not evidence of convergence or a new architecture.

## Identity and protection

The isolated branch starts at `351d855fc5a122f0356e91f669b48c9b6bdc95bb`, the
source recorded by the two collapsing distance-curriculum runs. The originally
named rl-brax-decoupling branch remains at `b0eed1e` and is not the execution source.
The paper branch has an existing untracked outputs directory. Neither that directory
nor the running old calibration scheduler is modified. New machine evidence belongs
under `artifacts/verification/ppo-stability-20261015/` in this worktree.

The original curriculum runs, checkpoints and their CSVs remain read-only under
`/home/tong/tongworkspace/simulation_dev/new_drone_playground/results/navigation_stability_fixes_v01/`.

## Diagnostic questions and discriminating interventions

1. Does retaining behavior-policy GRU state after an update cause immediate loss?
   Compare normal continuation with recomputation of the just-collected sequence
   under the updated actor, starting at the identical recorded boundary memory.
   Reduced action disagreement and retained successes would support a contribution.
   Equal losses would reject this limited intervention; it does not reconstruct
   history preceding the rollout boundary.
2. Does critic drift cause the first failure interval? Freeze only critic parameters
   and optimizer state after the identical checkpoint, preserving actor updates,
   RNG, environment and curriculum. Improved retention supports a contribution but
   does not prove critic bias is the unique cause or that freezing is a final recipe.
3. Do cumulative actor updates destroy the learned solution despite the existing
   local KL gate? Scale only actor LR by 0.25 from the same optimizer state. Compare
   measured action drift and paired successes at the same interactions. Historical
   scratch low-LR experiments failed; this continuation isolates the local effect.

First use LiDAR u2640, with 240 updates (122,880 interactions) and 60-update
evaluations. This contains the recorded 29/48 to 0/48 interval, before the next
curriculum phase. Evaluate S01/D01/D02/D03, which contain all 29 original successes;
S02/S03 must be included before any promotion. The source replay must reproduce
the individual episode outcomes before accepting any intervention result. The
control must show loss before interpreting a treatment as preventing that loss.
The check uses real rollout log-probability and recurrent-memory equality, not a
mock environment. A diagnostic improvement requires retaining at least 80% of
source successes and exceeding control retention at the final diagnostic update;
it does not count as formal convergence. Failed treatments remain in the report.

Depth uses u2880 as its independent replication source. Its later 1,440-update
failure interval crosses a curriculum transition and cannot be assigned the same
cause merely because the outcome looks similar.

## Final protocol fixed before selecting a new recipe

Use the original task/sensor/algorithm cells and C1-C6: three independent training
seeds, every main Navigation scene at least 23/25, three consecutive full validation
passes, then a separate frozen benchmark. No peak across models or different
recipes may be combined. Existing Tracking/Racing evidence requires provenance,
contract and raw-outcome checks before reuse. The integrated v0.2 specification
requires random initialization for all 18 cells, so old initialized Racing runs
cannot fill this matrix. The new user instruction explicitly restores three
consecutive passes and adds continued-learning stability; it is stricter than
ADR-0017's single complete validation pass. Preserve the historical protocol
labels rather than retroactively marking those old runs as passing the new test.

For the selected recipe, continue actual learning for at least 900,000 additional
interactions after the first three consecutive validation passes. This exceeds the
860,160-interaction peak-to-final-loss interval in the LiDAR anchor. Evaluate the
fixed validation cohort every 122,880 interactions rounded up to a whole update,
and at the end. Every check must still satisfy the original per-scene threshold;
at least 95% of previously successful validation cases must remain successful.
Keep the final model, all regression cases and a complete recoverable state.
Saving/rolling back to the first model is not a substitute for this test.

Training seeds remain 0/1/2 for formal comparison. Historical development cases
are used only for diagnosis. New final benchmark cases use a separately recorded
seed base at least 3,000,000, fixed before running, and cannot supply training data
or teachers. If a failed final benchmark informs a change, record that cohort as
development information and allocate a fresh final cohort.

For each sensor, algorithms share actual forward physics, controls, actor inputs
and backbone, task reward, initialization and sampling schedule. Critic, surrogate
loss, optimizer and differentiable rollout mechanics remain algorithm-specific.
Reward changes are common task changes, not a license to lower physical success
criteria. Pretraining and teacher methods must disclose provenance and cannot be
reported as pure scratch PPO without the corresponding evidence.

The experiment unit is an independently initialized training run. Report all three
seeds separately; evaluation episodes are not additional training replicates.

reach the existing Trainer, CLI, configuration and appropriate tests.
